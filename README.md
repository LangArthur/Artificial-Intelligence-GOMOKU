# Artificial-Intelligence-GOMOKU

AI playing gomoku on Piswork platform

### Prerequisites

install Piswork here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/piskvork/

You'll need python v3.7.

I recommand usage of auto-py-to-exe for converting .py executable to .exe : https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

### Installing

The makefile do not work for the moment so convert the file pbrain-gomoku-ai.py to an exe.

Then, open Piswork and setup your game using the AI exe.
